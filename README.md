# MLC (MIDI LED Controller)
Hardware design and firmare for my effect controller, which receives MIDI data from my Nord Stage keyboard and uses that to control an RGB LED strip mounted to it.

# Important note
I wrote most of this code when I was still in school. Moreover it's quite bound to the board design and the way the LED strip is mounted. Don't expext good quality or portability.
