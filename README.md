# MLC (MIDI LED Controller)
**This project is not in development anymore. Check out my [new version](https://github.com/danielschenk/mlc2).**

Hardware design and firmware for my effect controller, which receives MIDI data from my Nord Stage keyboard and uses that to control an RGB LED strip mounted to it.

# Important notes
- I wrote most of this code when I was still in school. Moreover, it's quite bound to the board design and the way the LED strip is mounted. Don't expext good quality or portability.
- This repository was moved from BitBucket to GitHub on July 31th, 2016. Hence, issue numbers mentioned in commits before this date do not correspond with issues in this GitHub repository.
